# ArchMyCamp

*Void Main*

*Inspired by Labrador Project*

## Why ArchMyCamp

While developing the Labrador Project, we chose to use Basecamp by 37signals. When the project approaches to the end, it's time to tidy up the work.

We want to backup all the discussion and files from the project on basecamp, so, we need a tool that helps us do the backup job.

At the beginning, I want to use pure bash to fulfill the task, but while reading the bcx-api on github, it occurs to me that I can do better. So, I thought to myself, screw it, let's build something real.

## Development Status

It's just the beginning of the project, I'm trying to build all the works in the interative style. I mean build the core task first, and then combine them together, finally polish the UI to something cool.
